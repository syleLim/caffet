Leo remembers how many grids are colored of red, brown. but doesn't remember how size of it.
Inputs are how many red, brown grids, write the function that returns width, height of caffet.

CONSTRAINT
 - # of grids is natural number 8 or more 5000 or less
 - # of red grids is natural number 1 or more 2000000 or less
 - caffet`s width over or same height<br><br><br>

Ex >
|brown|red|return|
|:---|:---|:---|
|10|2|[4, 3]|
|8|1|[3, 3]|
|24|24|[8, 6]|

first function is 93%, speed is 1%, so can be published 7 days after.<br>
second function is 30%, speed is 30%, so can be published 3 days after. but first function not end up yet, so published 7 days after with first function.<br>
third is 55%, speed is 5%, so can be published 9 days after.<br>
As a result, first publishing includes 2 functions at day 7, and second publishing includes 1 function at day 9.
